# Guidelines
Here are some tips that can be of help when writing recipes or cooking.

### Avoid Exact Quantities When Not Significant
Saying that a soup should have exactly 1 spice measure of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper can give an
unnecessary amount of detail, while it still hard to predict which exact quantity may yield best
taste in the end. Prefer simpler instructions such as "season with salt and pepper" and let the cook
decide what combination of quantities that produces the best taste.

For example, some spices that have spent some time on the shelf and are a bit older may taste a bit less,
and therefore be needed in greater quantities than if they were fresh. This is of course extremely
hard to account for when writing a recipe, so it can be easier to just state the required spices
without exact quantities.

### Prefer Visual Clues Over Exact Times
It is generally better to state, when possible, that "the carrots are ready when they have a hint of
brown color and are soft", rather than "cook them in the oven for 35 minutes". The later instruction
may yield very different end result depending on a lot of factors, such as the size and quality of
the carrots, how well the oven distributes heat and which temperature the carrots had before they
were put inside the oven.

### Use Many and Short Instructions
Prefer something like this

1. Peel and chop onion
2. Fry the onion until golden yellow
3. Add tomato sauce and basil
4. Mix with hand mixer

1. Peel, chop and fry the onion until it is golden yellow
2. Add tomato sauce and basil and mix with a hand mixer.

Each single instruction should be easy to remember. Every time you go back and look in the recipe
you should be on the next instruction (next number). This makes it easier to find the correct instruction.

### Divide The Recipe Into Several Parts
If a recipe consists of several different parts, for example;
a. Making pasta
b. Fry some fish
c. Mixing a sauce

divide these instructions and ingredients as much as possible. A good rule of thumb is, if the recipe
was printed and three different people were to cook parts of the recipe, it should be easy to just cut
the recipe into three pieces and hand it to each person, with no instruction overlapping.
See [example.md](example.md) for a good example of this.

Some more complex recipes may of course not allow for this, but it can be good to keep this in mind
when writing recipes, as it can help immensely whenever you will be several persons cooking together
from the same recipe.
